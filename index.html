      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I had a few different jobs but mostly worked as an IT technician for past several years.
        My responsibilities involved managing all aspects of various IT hardware and software and supporting users.
      </p>
      <p>
        I recently had an opportunity to participate in building an e-commerce website and realized that I really enjoy working to develop web solutions.
        Although my coding skills are not sufficient enough to build a full product on my own, I learned and saw much potential in what can be accomplished through developing and building web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the skills I am acquiring at LearningFuze, I seek to work as a full-stack developer. I would like to put my skills to use and gain as much experience as possible to create a beautiful and robust
        websites / web applications that will have an impact on businesses.
